## Problem Set 1: Test-first programming

Since ps1 is not possible anymore, we could solve a ps1 for an earlier version of the course.

Write black-box tests based on specifications, prior to writing code. Wrote classes to convert digits of pi between bases, express digits in base-26, convert base-26 digits into characters, and ultimately find English words in the resulting string of characters.

## Problem Set 2: 
No comments. I have not interest in problem 4.


## Problem Set 3:
I was completely stuck in the 2nd problem. I explain with detail in the code, but here is the gist of it. I couldn't figure out a proper way of writing the Listener. Recursion, which would make things x100 times easier, is not allowed due to the void return type in the specification, as well as the fact that the function which transverses the tree is not able to build the tree.
