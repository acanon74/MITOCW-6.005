# MITOCW-6.005
My solutions and notes for the MITOCW course 6.005 "Software Construction".


My notes can be found inside the "MITOCW6.005 Notes" folder. I am aware that they are mostly poorly summarized or straight up truncated copies of the original notes available at "https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/". I did not intend for them to serve more than a quick refresher for the future, so if you are planning to take this course, I strongly advise you to read the original notes instead.
