Exercises

1.

a. third string
b. because we enter the first if statement but the 
nested statement x == 0 is false so first is not printed.
Moreover, we did enter the first statement so the else 
is not executed, so second is not printed. 
Finally, we continue normal operation in the global
scope and third is printed as a result.
 
c.  
if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
            
else 
    System.out.println("second string");

System.out.println("third string");

d.
if (aNumber >= 0) {
    if (aNumber == 0) {
        System.out.println("first string");
    }
}            
else {
    System.out.println("second string");
}
System.out.println("third string");
