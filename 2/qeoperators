Exercises

1.
class ArithmeticDemo {

     public static void main (String[] args){
          
          int result = 3; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);

          result--; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result *= 2; // result is now 4
          System.out.println(result);

          result /= 2; // result is now 2
          System.out.println(result);

          result += 8; // result is now 10
          result %= 7; // result is now 3
          System.out.println(result);
     }
}

2.
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"

in the first statement ++i first evaluates and then it 
is printed.
So after the first i = 6.
However, in the second i++ evaluates after we evaluate 
println, so what is passed to println is i =6, which it 
prints. 
after the second println i++ its evaluated and i is now 7.
